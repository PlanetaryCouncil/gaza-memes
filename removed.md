* > **translated to English:** According to monitoring and documentation by the Freedoms Committee of the Palestinian Journalists Syndicate, targeting journalists' families has become a systematic and recurring pattern during the years 2023, 2024, and 2025, claiming the lives of approximately 706 members of journalists' families in the Gaza Strip. All indicators confirm that these targetings are not accidental incidents resulting from the conditions of war.
